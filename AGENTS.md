## Build
- Install:
  - npm ci
- Build:
  - npm run build

## Test
- Unit:
  - npm test
- Lint:
  - npm run lint

## Conventions
- Branch naming: feature/*, fix/*, refactor/*
- Commit style: conventional commits (feat:, fix:, refactor:, docs:, chore:)
- Scope rule: keep changes minimal per PR (one concern)
- Do not edit generated files (dist/, build/) unless explicitly required
